# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHTML Not Updating Div Content

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug where the `innerHTML` property in JavaScript fails to update the content of an HTML div element. The expected behavior is that the existing content should be replaced, but this does not happen. 

The bug is a result of the script executing before the `div` element is fully rendered by the browser.  Solutions involving proper timing are explored below.
